    In this mode, the caller is responsible for ensuring that all indices are within
    the bounds of the array, and any out-of-bounds access will result in undefined behavior.

    As an example, consider a 2-dimensional array. In this case, indices must be a tuple
    of length 2. Suppose that ``ind0`` and ``ind1`` are integer tiles
    of shapes ``(M, N, 1)`` and ``(M, 1, K)``, and both ``expected`` and ``desrired``
    are tiles of shape of ``(N, K)``:

        >>> # ind0: (M, N, 1),  ind1: (M, 1, K),  expected: (N, K),  desired: (N, K)
        >>> ct.atomic_cas(array, (ind0, ind1), expected, desired)

    The above call to `atomic_cas` will behave similarly to the following pseudocode::

        in parallel, for all (i, j, k) such that 0<=i<M, 0<=j<N, i<=k<K:
            if not check_bounds or (0 <= ind0[i, j, 0] < array.shape[0]
                                    and 0 <= ind1[i, 0, k] < array.shape[1]):
                do atomically:
                    actual = array[ind0[i, j, 0], ind1[i, 0, k]]
                    if actual == expected[j, k]:
                        array[ind0[i, j, 0], ind1[i, 0, k]] = desired[j, k]
                result[i, j, k] = actual
            else:
                result[i, j, k] = expected[j, k]

    Examples:

        >>> indices = ct.arange(32, dtype=ct.int32)
        >>> expected = ct.full((32,), 1, dtype=ct.int32)
        >>> desired = ct.arange(32, dtype=ct.int32)
        >>> old_value = ct.atomic_cas(array, indices, expected, desired)

    For each individual element, the operation is performed atomically,
    but the operation as a whole is not atomic, and the order of individual writes is unspecified.

    `{op_name}()` follows the same convention as :py:func:`gather()` and :py:func:`scatter()`:
    `indices` must be a tuple whose length equals the `array` rank.
    All elements of this tuple must be integer tiles or scalars of the same shape,
    or different shapes that are broadcastable to a common shape.
    If the array is 1-dimensional, `indices` can be passed as a single tile
    rather than a tuple of length 1.

    `update` must be a scalar or a tile whose shape is broadcastable to the
    common shape of `indices`.

    By default, `{op_name}()` checks that indices are within the bounds of the array.
    For indices that are out of bounds, no operation is performed, and an implementation-defined
    value is returned. To disable bounds checking, set `check_bounds` to ``False``.
    In this mode, the caller is responsible for ensuring that all indices are within
    the bounds of the array, and any out-of-bounds access will result in undefined behavior.
